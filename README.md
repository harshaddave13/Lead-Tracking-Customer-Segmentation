This repository contains anonymized, fictionalized examples of my Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM customizations.
They are based on real-world implementations I’ve delivered for clients, but with all client-specific data removed.

The examples focus on:

Lead Tracking – capturing, qualifying, and managing leads through customized business process flows.

Customer Segmentation – grouping customers for targeted engagement using Dynamics 365 views, marketing lists, and Power BI analytics.
